## Abstract
*Detecting and segmenting object instances is a common task in biomedical applications. Examples range from detecting 
lesions on functional magnetic resonance images, to the detection of tumours in histopathological images and extracting 
quantitative single-cell information from microscopy imagery, where cell segmentation is a major bottleneck. 
Attention-based transformers are state-of-the-art in a range of deep learning fields. They have recently been proposed 
for segmentation tasks where they are beginning to outperforming other  methods. We present a novel attention-based 
cell detection transformer (Cell-DETR) for direct end-to-end instance segmentation. While the segmentation performance 
is on par with a state-of-the-art instance segmentation method, Cell-DETR is simpler and faster. We showcase the 
method's contribution in a the typical use case of segmenting yeast in microstructured environments, commonly employed 
in systems or synthetic biology. For the specific use case, the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art tools 
for semantic segmentation and additionally predicts the individual object instances. The fast and accurate instance 
segmentation performance increases the experimental information yield for a posteriori data processing and 
makes online monitoring of experiments and closed-loop optimal experimental design feasible.*


## Architecture
![Cell-DETR_Architecture](images/CELL_DETR.PNG)
<br/>Architecture of the end-to-end instance segmentation network, with brightfield specimen image input and an instance segmentation prediction as output.
The backbone CNN encoder extracts image features that then feed into both the transformer encoder-decoder for class and bounding box prediction, as well
as to the CNN decoder for segmentation. The transformer encoded features, as well as the transformer decoded features, are feed into a multi-head-attention
module and together with the image features from the CNN backbone feed into the CNN decoder for segmentation. Skip connections additionally bridge
between the backbone CNN encoder and the CNN decoder. Input and output resolution is 128 Ã— 128 pixels.


## Dependencies
The Cell-DETR implementation uses multiple existing implementations. First, deformable convolutions v2 [2] are used based
on the [implementation](https://github.com/chengdazhi/Deformable-Convolution-V2-PyTorch/tree/pytorch_1.0.0) of 
[Dazhi Cheng](https://github.com/chengdazhi). Second, [pade activation units](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06732) [4] 
are utilized base on the [official implementation](https://github.com/ml-research/pau), by the authors. And third, the 
[pixel adaptive convolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05373) [3] [implementation](https://github.com/NVlabs/pacnet) by 
[Nvidia](https://github.com/NVlabs) is used. The pade activation unit implementation as well as the pixel adaptive 
convolution implementation are adopted slightly and are included in this repository. All dependencies can be installed
by executing the following commands:

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/ChristophReich1996/Cell-DETR.git
cd Cell-DETR
pip install --no-deps -r requirements.txt -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
git clone https://github.com/chengdazhi/Deformable-Convolution-V2-PyTorch
cd Deformable-Convolution-V2-PyTorch
git checkout pytorch_1.0.0
python setup.py build install
cd ../pade_activation_unit/cuda
python setup.py build install
```

The transformer [5] implementation is based on the 
[official implementation of DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr) [1].
